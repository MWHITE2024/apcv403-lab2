        <h2>Race and Racism in America</h2>
<p>My interviewee is my 70 year old female African-American Grandmother Evelyn from New York. Evelyn lives alone in staten island, New York. She has a daughter named Heather who is my mother. She has to care for herself  because her husband was killed by thugs in the neighborhood 10 years ago. Evelyn finished high school but never went to college so she has no degree.  As an African-American woman, it was not easy for her to find employment most of the time. She was forced to do menial jobs to make ends meet for most of her life. Currently, Evelyn is retired but is a very involved community member at her church. Evelyn grew up in a period where there was a lot of racial division. In that period, African-Americans were treated as second-class citizens. It was difficult for Evelyn's mother to raise her 2 kids as she was and working hard to make ends meet. These family difficulties made Evelyn decide not to purse a better education because of how expensive it was so she started working and caring for herself as soon as she could.</p>

	<p>On the historical part of African-American history, I discussed with her the black codes. Black code is the <strong>“set of laws enacted throughout the southern states like South Carolina and Mississippi in 1865 after the American civil war”</strong> (Week 3 Black Codes Article). The Black codes required African-Americans to sign annual labor contracts that ensured they received the lowest pay possible for their work. The code also had anti-enticement measures to prevent employers from paying African-American workers higher salaries than their current employers. If African Americans failed to follow through on the contract, they could be arrested and sentenced to unpaid labor or fined. It was believed that <strong>“fees from the fine were the easiest way to reinstitute servitude, as African-Americans earned so tiny that they could not pay a higher fine”</strong> (Week 3 Black Codes Article). Failure to pay the penalties allowed the state to order them to work off their balances. This system was called Debt peonage. Most of these works were agricultural on White farms, just the same as the work African-Americans did during slavery. When I asked Evelyn about this she scoffed. She briefly talked about her work experience after finishing school. Evelyn worked at a shop that sold flowers and other household items. She worked long hours cleaning and maintaining the appearance of the store while getting paid the bare minimum to support herself. There were times when white customers came in and would leave or give her dirty looks when they saw her working there. She said <strong>“the abolishment of slavery was supposed to be the turning point in history for us, but instead they found a way to still treat us just as inhumanely with the black codes and other ways of exclusion making us feel uncomfortable. It took about another 50 years before public perception started to really shift”</strong>. Evelyn expressed gratitude that she didn't have to live through the times of slavery and the black codes but that dosent make it hurt any less she said. <strong>“The Civil right movement was monumental and the ripple effects of the mid to late 1800s were felt through the 90s”</strong>.</p>

<p>Before she retired her last job was working at a nursing home taking care of elderly patients who could no longer care for themselves. At this time it was the early 2000s and things were alot different. This was the highest paying job she worked at earning $7 an hour which at the time was great compared to what she was making at her first job. It was nice she said, <strong>“I actually enjoyed working there because i felt like i was making a difference and felt accepted for who i am. I did not experience much racism at that nursing home and for  the first time i didn't feel different from anyone else.”</strong> </p>
	
    <p>I also discussed with her the issue of the wage gap among women in the United States as stated in the article “Closing the wage gap is especially important for women of color in difficult times.” Here, I gave her my findings on the research i did on my own time and in this class. In the United States, African-American women are paid less than white, non-Hispanic women. <strong>“African-American women are paid roughly 80 cents for every dollar spent by their white, non-Hispanic female counterparts”</strong> (National Women's Law Center, NWLC). Since 1979, African-American and Hispanic women have seen much slower and smaller growth of 25% and 15%, respectively. A study by the Institute for Women's Policy Research found that <strong>“20 percent of African-American women reported being worried about having enough food for their families, compared to 10 percent of white women”</strong> (National Women's Law Center, NWLC). Evelyn says women have always been treated differently than men, things have gotten better but the stigma that women aren't as capable and they should be housewives instead of working has taken a different form. <strong>“Employers aren't outright denying women job opportunities as much as they used to, instead they are paying them less and have them stuck at lower end jobs compared to their counterparts”.</strong> She never bothered asking how much more the men or whites were making at her jobs but she always assumed that they were making more and getting treated better than she was. <strong>“Its a terrible way to think but i was just acknowledging the reality of the situation, no mater what i did i always thought i was starting out below everyone else because of my gender and race".</strong> This doesn't only apply to women as we've discussed in class. Men are subject to similar circumstances but based on race instead of gender. It is estimated that <strong>“40 percent of Black and Hispanic adults are low income in the U.S in 2021”</strong> (Kochhar). She also mentions the concept of this gender discrimination reaching further than the workplace using the example of medical gaslighting and the notion that women are always hysterical causing them to be viewed as crazy and irrational.</p>

	<p>Finally, we discussed why African-Americans' unemployment rate is high. This is found in the article <strong>“Why Are Employment Rates so Low among Black Men?”</strong> Most African-Americans have lower education, skills, and work experience. <strong>“Discrimination and social isolation also lead to African-Americans' unemployment since workplaces do not prefer having black people at their workplaces” (Holzer).</strong> An article looking at labor force statistics found that “unemployment rates were much higher for African Americans (11.4 percent) compared to average (8.1 percent)” (U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics). The theories I will discuss with my interviewee are Conflict theory and Functionalism theory. First, conflict theory suggests <strong>“that dominant groups use law and its enforcement mechanism to reduce threats to their interest posed by those they label dangerous”.</strong> Conflict theory is often applied to inequalities of gender, race, ethnicity, and social class. From the perspective of United States history, conflict theory examines the numerous past and current struggles between the white ruling class and other racial minorities like African-Americans. The rising power of the black minority after the American civil war made the Whites feel threatened. For example, <strong>“Vivien Thomas (1910-1985), the black surgical technician who aided in developing the groundbreaking surgical technique that saves the lives of "blue babies,"</strong> was not considered a technician due to her color but was referred to as janitor and paid less” (Holzer). It is harder for African-American women to find jobs in the United States today. This is because whites still don't consider them favorable in delivery. They were still viewed as unschooled.</p>
	
    <p>Second, functionalism theory emphasizes that all the elements of the society have functions that maintain order and stability in the community and promote solidarity. In a state of social balance, we observe that people from various racial backgrounds interact harmoniously. Problems only arise when one or racial groups experience discrimination and inequality. This creates conflict and tension resulting in temporary dysfunction of the social system. An example, <strong>“the killing of an African-American man called George Floyd by white police in 2020 stirred up protests demanding racial justice and changes in the police department”</strong> (The New York Times). To seek equilibrium, the police department and various parts of the system required changes and compensatory adjustments. Evelyn said she was defintltey denied opportunities based on the color of her skin. She said this was mainly because employers thought African Americans were dirty, lazy and had criminal backgrounds. This stigma is still around she says <strong>“A black man or woman could have better credentials than their white counterpart but will be denied the job because of these rooted belief systems about our people”</strong>. Racism will always be part of the identity of this country no matter how hard we try to fight for change. Things are alot better than they were but that leaves no room to get complacent she says <strong>“because of how deeply rooted racism is in our past if we let our guard down to much things will start happening that can send us back years and we've worked too hard to get here to start moving backwards".</strong> </p>

<p>I learned various things from the interview experience. For instance, I realized that Evelyn, my interviewee, has seen a lot and that im very lucky to grow up in a time where both races and genders are considered equal by most. Its important to realize how far we've come but not get complacent and forget all the pain and suffering that was endured to let future generations have this freedom that we so often take for granted. I also learned that i should be proud of my history and proud to be an African American. There is no reason for me to feel ashamed for something that was out of my control like the color of my skin and my grandmother agreed. Evelyn said <strong>“I never felt ashamed of my race when growing up and you shouldn't either, I took the adversity and used it to become a stronger and better person and you should as well. If you do you'll accomplish great things.”</strong> For the final question i asked Evelyn if she feels unsafe when traveling into whiter areas of town. I don't she said, <strong>“In the last 10 years ive only gotten a few looks in my direction but nothing compared to what would happen in the 90s. I feel safe being in those neighborhoods now and that is something I am grateful for.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>ADDENDUM</strong><br>
 I decided to use h2 throughout the separate headings to maintain the style since they all hold similar importance in the title. When I added in the bulk of the paper, it looked like one big paragraph, so I separated it by using multiple "paragraph" commands. I went through each paragraph and used the "strong" command to bold any quotes. I looked up what the command would be for an ordered list and found the "ol" and "li" commands. I chose this paper because it's unique, and I had a lot of fun writing it for my previous class.
